# Hi, I’m Elvis

I'm a backend-leaning developer from Sweden with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I'm passionate about writing clean, efficient code and building systems that are reliable and easy to maintain.

While I'm still early in my career, I’ve spent a lot of time learning by doing , building projects, exploring different parts of the stack, and focusing especially on how things work behind the scenes. I enjoy working with APIs, databases, and backend logic, and I’m always looking to improve and pick up new tools.
